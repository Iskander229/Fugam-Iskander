A Unity-made horror level - group project.

Made use of C#'s potential robust coding abilities in the engine and had fun with a lot of Engine aspects such as:

Physics

Lighting (A lot)

Materials

Sculpting

Audio (a Lot)

To sum up, I did a lot of design work in this level, and didn't forget to complement it with a robust C# part when it was needed to correspond to the Horror Setting.
