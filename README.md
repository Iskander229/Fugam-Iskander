A forked version of a horror game group project in UNITY

Made use of C#'s potential robust coding abilities in the engine and had fun with a lot of Engine aspects such as:

Physics

Lighting (A lot)

Materials

Sculpting

Audio (a Lot)

To sum up, I did a lot of design part in this level, and didn't forget to complement it with technical part as a robust C# code when it was needed for the Level to correspond to the Horror Setting.
